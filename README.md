# General Auction Functionality

Would like to create a basic secure auction contract for various fundraising activities. This will be basic, we can add some additional auction logic support, such as Dutch, Batch, or English auctions - but this is more the economics part. 

Another part of the solution should be a governance token, as this would enable to trigger some longer community engagement and DAO-like participations. Currently looking into various DAO features for this kind of support.

## List Of Basic Features

- limited auction participation (KYC, only approved wallet list)
- locking of funds for the auctions / with time-locked withdrawal if not successful
- transfer of raised funds to the preset address (contract, or EOA)

## More Features
- support for tokenomics functionalities, like % of raised funds, go to governance, % of funds to future development track, etc ...
- token creation (ERC20, or ERC777)
- use defi/dexes to onboard funds, or connect pools
- define a limited set of pools ...


Inspired by miso and gnosis auction, just want to do a basic simplified variant of this. 

This is still all over the place as I would like to keep some things open, and of course, limited by IRL time. Now let's see what comes out at the end...

Cheers to all
